* warnings spewed about chicken.h: deprecated conversion from string constant to ‘char*’ [-Wwrite-strings]

When string constants are assigned or passed to functions, C++ wants the
type declared as "const char*" instead of simply "char*".  In sjamaan's
words, "C++ is being silly".  We suppress the warnings by passing
-Wno-write-strings to the compiler.
